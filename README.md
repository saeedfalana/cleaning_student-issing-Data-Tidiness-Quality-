Cleaning sequence headers (e.g., "### Missing Data" , "#### treatments: Missing records (280 instead of 350)", "##### Define", "##### Code", and "##### Test") are set up for you for all required cleaning operations. Your tasks are to fill in the Define, Code, and Test sequences.

Since some of the cleaning operations are dependent upon earlier operations, if your cleaning code is wrong in this notebook, later cleaning operations as shown in the solution notebooks may not work correctly. Be sure to thoroughly code and test your cleaning operations.
